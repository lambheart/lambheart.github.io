      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the fall semester of 2025, I researched the importance of South Korean technology firms as an underappreciated node of the semiconductor supply chain. The findings and recommendations for export controls were posted in a Substack article titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://lambheart.substack.com/p/south-korea-and-the-hbm-bottleneck&#34;&gt;South Korea and the HBM Bottleneck&lt;/a&gt;, arguing for export controls that were more predictable and sensitive to structural constraints that South Korean firms faced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The preceding analysis treats export controls and supply-chain bottlenecks as meaningful constraints in U.S.–China competition on frontier AI development. While this framing reflects dominant policy discourse, I remain uncertain about several of its underlying assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
