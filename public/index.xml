      <title>Circulation and Attention in Contemporary Image Culture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written for an art history course on contemporary art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the contemporary world, images are encountered most frequently on the internet, on social media, on television, and in advertising. These images are often designed for rapid circulation and instant legibility—circulating, shaping behavior, and commanding attention—no longer primarily representational or contemplative. Social media facilitates the automation of attention and valuation. Attention is guided by systems instead of reflective choice, that is, algorithms determine what is seen; and images are evaluated instantly and quantitatively in the form of engagement metrics. When attention becomes measurable and worth is calculated (not debated) through algorithmic systems, social media transforms the act of seeing into a data-driven process. Within this image economy, contemporary art takes on a marginal status, and it appears as though the onus is on contemporary art to distinguish itself as a protest against obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She is involved in AI policy research and organizing, and currently serves as Policy Lead for the Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her research focuses on how political elites use uncertainty as a governing resource in the development of national AI strategies. She is particularly interested in how uncertainty is mobilized to justify rapid resource allocation, securitization, and institutional coordination, and how these dynamics differ between the United States and China. Through analysis of public-facing elite discourse, she examines how narratives of risk, competition, and inevitability structure international diplomacy and sustain political legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
