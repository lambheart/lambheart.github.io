      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Written for an art history course on contemporary art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the contemporary world, images are encountered most frequently on the internet, on social media, on television, and in advertising. These images are often designed for rapid circulation and instant legibility—circulating, shaping behavior, and commanding attention—no longer primarily representational or contemplative. Social media facilitates the automation of attention and valuation. Attention is guided by systems instead of reflective choice, that is, algorithms determine what is seen; and images are evaluated instantly and quantitatively in the form of engagement metrics. When attention becomes measurable and worth is calculated (not debated) through algorithmic systems, social media transforms the act of seeing into a data-driven process. Within this image economy, contemporary art takes on a marginal status, and it appears as though the onus is on contemporary art to distinguish itself as a protest against obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
