            <h1>WHAT'S SHE DOING RIGHT NOW?!</h1>
            <p>i recently participated in the technica hackathon at umd, where we built a gamified website about environmentalism! i drew lots of stuff for it, and learned some react</p>

            <p>independently, i'm working on seeing how polarized the US Supreme Court is, using AI! </p>

            <p>other than that, i'm probably working on improving this site, or doing leetcode T_T</p>

            <br>
            <h3>keep track with me!</h3>
            <ul class = "blog">
                <li>supreme court analysis - </li>
                <li>
                    i just got rapidfuzz to work in matching differing supreme court case names in two datasets! one has a column of facts for each court case, and one has all the ideology score calculations i made for each year. the idea is that: given the facts of the case, will the models improve? right now they sort of suck :<span>&#40;</span> 
                    now i'm working on dividing my datasets into smaller ones to see if 
                    training my models on smaller datasets improves them. after that, i'll start merging the two datasets so court case facts can be used in training.

                <li>
                    right now what i really want is to make this section look more like a blog, with blog previews that you can click into. 
                    i'd really rather not have to manually type blog previews, dates, titles, etc. for each post, so i'll need backend and a database, probably. 
                    unfortunately, i have very limited understanding of sql or node.js. so i'll work on that slowly. i might be wrong, but i think that also means 
                    i can't use github pages for this website anymore.
